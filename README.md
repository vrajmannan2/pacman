<p> This is my pacmen project, <br>
  the objective of this project is to have pacmen move around and generate. <br>
  When the pacman hits the wall it should bounce off. <br> 
  You can run the program by clicking "Add new pacmen" on the top right then pressing the "Start" button on the top right.<br>
  I look to improve this program in the near future by adding different color pacmen and some other objects.<br>
